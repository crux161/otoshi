# otoshi お通し

A fork of "omakub" radically rethought so as no tonpush commercial services via applications and useless configurations. Ideally the initial framework will act as a system to set themes and other personalized touches to a fresh install.

## Roadmap
• Reimplementation of Omakub (take out the sucky commerical bits)

• Isolate and repackage concepts for themes so they are easily backed up, reloaded, or switched over to other themes which will ideally be sharable. 

• hide SFW furry art as easteregg ^v^*
